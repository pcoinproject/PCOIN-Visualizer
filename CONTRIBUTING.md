# Contributing to BitListen

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

I'll be upfront about this one: What BitListen needs the most is a complete rewrite. This code is messier than an elementary school spaghetti night fundraiser üçù. I wrote BitListen very quickly as a prototype in 2013, while I was still in college, and haven't gotten around to rewriting it.

Aside from the rewrite, here are a few things to consider:

* Ability for BitListen to run properly and sound nice in a background tab (the big issue is that most browsers seem to throttle background tabs, causing the sound to batch up and sound choppy)

* Possibility that a canvas-based rendering scheme could be more lightweight than the current DOM-based rendering scheme. It's something to weigh the pros and cons of.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to open a GitHub issue or [email me](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/contact/) directly. Thanks!
